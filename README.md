#  SataFood

## Features

* This project is fully designed progmatically, with no storyboard, no xib and no scene delegate

* No third party liberaries are included, Instead of that every thing implemented using pure swift

* I have implemented the MVVM pattern as an architectural patten and binding using properties and closures

* I have implemented a generic network layer using URLSession that can be implemented using any data type

* I have the NetworkServiceProtocol that is used for both network layer and unit testing

* I have included unit tests to test the data retrieving from backend, and implemented mock objects to simulate real objects

* This app supports dark theme as well as light theme

* I have implemented compositional layout to enable scrolling in both directions (verticaly and horizontaly)
